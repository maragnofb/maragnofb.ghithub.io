<h1>Quick hummus recipe</h1>

<h2>This recipe makes quick, tasty hummus, with no messing. It has been adapted from a number of different recipes that I have read over the years.</h2>

<p><br>Hummus is a delicious thick paste used heavily in Greek and Middle Eastern dishes. It is very tasty with salad, grilled meats and pitta breads.

    <br><br><h3>Ingredients</h3>

    1 can (400g) of chick peas (garbanzo beans)
    <br>175g of tahini
    <br>6 sundried tomatoes
    <br>Half a red pepper
    <br>A pinch of cayenne pepper
    <br>1 clove of garlic
    <br>A dash of olive oil
    <br>
    <br><h3>Instructions</h3>

Remove the skin from the garlic, and chop coarsely
<br>Remove all the seeds and stalk from the pepper, and chop coarsely
<br>Add all the ingredients into a food processor
<br>Process all the ingredients into a paste.
<br>If you want a coarse "chunky" hummus, process it for a short time
<br>If you want a smooth hummus, process it for a longer time

<br><br>For a different flavour, you could try blending in a small measure of lemon and coriander, chili pepper, lime and chipotle, harissa and mint, or spinach and feta cheese. Experiment and see what works for you.

<br><br><h3>Storage</h3>

<br>Refrigerate the finished hummus in a sealed container. You should be able to use it for about a week after you've made it. If it starts to become fizzy, you should definitely discard it.

<br>Hummus is suitable for freezing; you should thaw it and use it within a couple of months.</p>
