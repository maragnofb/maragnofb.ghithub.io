<h1>Quick hummus recipe</h1>

<p><strong>This recipe makes quick, tasty hummus, with no messing.</strong><br>
    <del>It has been adapted from a number of different recipes that
        I have read over the years.

<p>Hummus is a delicious thick paste used heavily in Greek and Middle Eastern dishes. <u>It is very tasty with salad,
    grilled meats and pitta breads.</u></p>

<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<ul>
    <li><em>1 can (400g) of chick peas (garbanzo beans)</em></li>
    <li><em>175g of tahini</em></li>
    <li><em>6 sundried tomatoes</em></li>
    <li><em>Half a red pepper</em></li>
    <li><em>A pinch of cayenne pepper</em></li>
    <li><em>1 clove of garlic</em></li>
    <li><em>A dash of olive oil</em></li>
</ul>
<h2>Instructions</h2>
<ol>
    <li>
        <mark>Remove the skin from the garlic, and chop coarsely</mark>
    </li>
    <li>
        <mark>Remove all the seeds and stalk from the pepper, and chop coarsely</mark>
    </li>
    <li>
        <mark>Add all the ingredients into a food processor</mark>
    </li>
    <li>
        <mark>Process all the ingredients into a paste</mark>
    </li>
    <li>
        <mark>If you want a coarse "chunky" hummus, process it for a short time</mark>
    </li>
    <li>
        <mark>If you want a smooth hummus, process it for a longer time</mark>
    </li>
</ol>

<p>For a different flavour, you could try blending in a small measure of lemon and coriander, chili pepper, lime and
    chipotle, harissa and mint, or spinach and feta cheese. Experiment and see what works for you.</p>

<h2>Storage</h2>

<p>Refrigerate the finished hummus in a sealed container. You should be able to use it for about a week after you've
    made it. If it starts to become fizzy, you should definitely discard it.
    <br><br>Hummus is suitable for freezing; <em>you should thaw it and use it within a couple of months.</em></p>
